## Philosophy

In recent years, thanks to the development of web technologies, the Internet has become an information processing center, which has led to the emergence of such amazing projects, including <a href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a>, <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and others. These tools increase developer productivity and allow you to create fast, testable, and extensible applications. These projects have many excellent libraries, helpers, and tools, but none of them effectively solves one of the most difficult and time-consuming problems of modern web testing.

Grinch aims to provide a ready-made foundation that allows you to effortlessly create user-friendly, fast, flexible and easily maintainable e2e scenarios. Grinch's coding style is largely inspired by the style of frontend frameworks, where various sections of code are grouped into a tree-like structure.
